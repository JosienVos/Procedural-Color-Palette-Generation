This Unityproject accompanies the tutorial on color palette generation over at josienvos.nl/tutorial/color/
It includes example scenes and scripts for the following subjects:
- generating color palettes based on color theory and the relationships between the colors in the palette
- using input to influence and control said generated color palettes
- applying it to objects in a scene (in two manners), as well as fog and skybox
- using a shader with propertyblocks to limit material instancing
